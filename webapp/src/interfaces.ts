* This interface is not used, but exists to demonstrate how interfaces are exported in vue. Interfaces are used to map a model into a Typescript object.
* For example, if the RestEndPoint contains a method for returning a specific object. An interface would be added to this file which contains all
* the object's variable names and types. Then when response a is received on the frontend, a TypeScript object could be populated as follows:
*
* typescriptObject: exampleInterface = response.data
